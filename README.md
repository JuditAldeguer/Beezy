# Technical Test - Beezy

## My project

- Where to locate it  
   My work is in the Github repository and you can easily find the link to Heroku that gives access to the latest version of my **master branch** in section _About_. [Access the web](https://breaking-bad--wiki.herokuapp.com/)

  I want to emphasize that I have followed a **responsive design**, which varies when going from mobile version to tablet and desktop and I have used **Bootstrap**, which I am learning now, for the CSS.

  On the other hand, as you can see, this work consists of two branches **dev branch** for everything that is in development and **master branch** that contains the final product.

- What is it  
  It is a web application that serves to visualize the characters of the Breaking Bad series.

  - Obtain information on the initial characters thanks to a first call to the **API** and **useEffect**.
  - Paint the initial characters.
  - Change the display order of the characters: by Name, by Nickname.
  - Possibility to **filter** the characters according to name, status and appearance in the series "Better Call Saul".
  - For a better structure, it is broken down into **Components**.
  - By clicking on a character, see its **Detailed Information**.
  - Three different visualizations using **Route, Switch**.
  - Report with a different display if the url does not exist, **notFoundPage**, with the use of **ModalWindows**.
  - Using **Bootstrap** for styling.  
  - Introduction of **Typescript** and **Testing**, which I am learning.


- What parts does it have  
  It contains three clear parts:

  1. The _header_
     - Page title
     - Hamburger menu
  2. The _main_
     - Form for filtering
     - Characters
  3. The _footer_

 
- What could be added  
  - Add more testing and work with Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology.
  - Possibility of adding more functionalities such as, for example:
    - Search by nickname / actor.
    - When there are more than 10 characters as a result of the API, incorporate a component that allows you to navigate from one page to another.
    - Save the data in LocalStorage / BBDD the characters. 


- What technologies does the project use
  I have used the languages HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Bootstrap y React.  
  The CSS preprocessor used has been SAAS and I have used the _automatization of gulp_.

- How to install  
  Thanks to the React-Template the installation is very simple, you only need _Visual Studio Code_ (or other code editor) with the corresponding extensions, a browser such as _Chrome_ and _Github_.

- How it is executed  
  Once these tools are well located, with the commands <npm install> y <npm start> will open the project in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you can start using the React-Template and its facilities.

- How the tests are tested  
  With the command <npm run testl> and you can start using testing.

I hope you like my work, of course I still have a lot to improve, but I have plenty of motivation! I hope you can give me directions to continue improving.
Thank you in advance!!
